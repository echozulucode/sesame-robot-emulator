/**
 * SHA-256 over the exact bytes the browser received.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `firmware/upstream/` is fetched by `scripts/fetch-upstream.*` and is
 * gitignored, so the four annotated files are absent from a clean clone and
 * are *not* guaranteed to be the bytes L3 measured when it wrote
 * `hardware/source-annotations.json`. Every line number in that file — 90
 * symbol ranges, 261 citations — is an offset into a specific tree. Render a
 * different tree behind those offsets and the pane shows real C++, correctly
 * syntax-highlighted, with the highlight box around the wrong function. That
 * failure is invisible to a learner, which makes it worse than an error
 * message, so nothing may be rendered until the bytes have been checked.
 *
 * ## Why not `crypto.subtle`
 *
 * `crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', …)` is right there and is faster. It is also
 * only defined in a secure context: `http://127.0.0.1` qualifies today, an
 * `http://` LAN address does not, and the failure mode is `undefined is not a
 * function` at exactly the moment the integrity gate was supposed to run. A
 * gate that disappears when the page is served differently is not a gate. This
 * is ~70 lines, has no dependency, runs everywhere, and costs about 4 ms on the
 * largest of the four files (297 kB `face-bitmaps.h`) — paid once per file,
 * lazily, on the click that opens it.
 *
 * Verified against the NIST vectors and against `node:crypto` in
 * `src/__tests__/source.test.ts`.
